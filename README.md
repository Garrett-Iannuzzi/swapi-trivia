## SWAPI-trivia

### Overview:

- SWAPI-trivia is an informational directory based around the Star Wars universe. A user can login with their name, favorite Star Wars quote, and chosen skill level. Providing there are no login errors the user can scroll through the list of Star Wars classics that are fetched from a third party API. A user can select a movie, upon this selection another fetch is run for the character information. There are a number of smaller API calls that make up this information. The user also has the ability to keep track of their favorite characters via the heart icon. If a user forgets their skill level they can hover over the Falcon to get their information. May the force be with you!
